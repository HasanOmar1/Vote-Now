I have created a phone responsive voting site using React.
First there is a login page , I have used mockapi to create my own data.
You can log in as admin which has more features than normal user such as admin panel.

### Log in as admin:

username : hasan@gmail.com
<br>
password : admin

### Log in as a user:

username : Diana.Rempel89@yahoo.com
<br>
password : diana

[There are more users in the api which u can see from the admin panel]

---

After you login you will be directed to the voting page where you can
vote on four cool cats and you can vote for your favorite one,
you can also change your vote anytime u want.

You also have a navbar where you can logout of your account.

---

If you are logged in as an admin you will find the admin panel when
you click on your name.

There you will find all the accounts in the api and you can see
who voted and who did not.

I have also added a total votes which shows how many accounts voted.

!This site is not perfect , it has some bugs.
